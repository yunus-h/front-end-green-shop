# GREEN SHOP



![alt text](./src/assets/images/greenshop_logo.png)

## Green Shop is a platform to bring together people who love beautiful house plants so they can buy or sell live plants, plant cuttings, seeds, accessories, and more. I personally love plants, especially house plants. I have a lot of plants at home such as monstera, photos, and others. these plants are increasing in number and density, so I have to throw them away. It's a shame, and I know there are a lot of people out there who want to maintain and care for the plants that I threw away. This gave me the idea to create a Green Shop, a place where ordinary people like me can sell and buy plants.

## Here are some pictures of the Green Shop:

## Getting Started:

#### Before creating the Green Shop project, I made a plan using Trello, and also created an ERD with Lucid Chart. Here's an image of the ERD and also the Trello link.

#### Green Shop back end is built with Express and Node. The database is built with MongoDB.  The back-end and front-end applications implement JWT token-based authentication to sign up, sign in, and sign out users. The front-end application is built with React. 

#### The Green App is not yet able to perform buying and selling transactions, but only focuses on User Authentication (sign-up/sign-in), Product creation, Product show, product update, and product delete. Also review products from users other than the product owner.

### Technologies used:
Express, Node, React, JWT, MongoDB, Postman, Dotenv, Bcrypt  

### Next steps: 

Green Shop still has many limitations, if I have enough time, I will develop this app so that it can make payment transactions, calculate the average rating of each product, display products by category.
